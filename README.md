A short project description: 
This project is part of the HNG13 DevOps Stage 0 task,
where I set up and deployed a simple web page on an AWS EC2 instance.
The task involved creating an index.html file containing my personal details
(name, Slack username, platform, and date), 
securely connecting to the EC2 instance via SSH, 
and transferring the file using SCP.
The page was then served publicly using Nginx.
